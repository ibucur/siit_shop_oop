# The Informal School Shop API Project

In order to start using the project, please download the repository and save it on your shop main folder. Make sure the index.php file is in the shop root.

Execute it and, if you see any problem (except a success response), this means some configuration is wrong. Therefore, search for it, correct it and make sure it is working well. 

This should be done until the next lecture.
